The PXE ROM used in BACH's PXE VM builds was generated by rom-o-matic.  It's not practical to rely on rom-o-matic for each and every VM build, so a static rom is retained as a cookbook file in the bach_cluster deployment cookbook.

Here is the original curl string used to generate the current ROM:

    $CURL -o gpxe-1.0.1-80861004.rom "http://rom-o-matic.net/gpxe/gpxe-1.0.1/contrib/rom-o-matic/build.php" -H "Origin: http://rom-o-matic.net" -H "Host: rom-o-matic.net" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -H "Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8" -H "Referer: http://rom-o-matic.net/gpxe/gpxe-1.0.1/contrib/rom-o-matic/build.php" -H "Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3" --data "version=1.0.1&use_flags=1&ofmt=ROM+binary+%28flashable%29+image+%28.rom%29&nic=all-drivers&pci_vendor_code=8086&pci_device_code=1004&PRODUCT_NAME=&PRODUCT_SHORT_NAME=gPXE&CONSOLE_PCBIOS=on&BANNER_TIMEOUT=20&NET_PROTO_IPV4=on&COMCONSOLE=0x3F8&COMSPEED=115200&COMDATA=8&COMPARITY=0&COMSTOP=1&DOWNLOAD_PROTO_TFTP=on&DNS_RESOLVER=on&NMB_RESOLVER=off&IMAGE_ELF=on&IMAGE_NBI=on&IMAGE_MULTIBOOT=on&IMAGE_PXE=on&IMAGE_SCRIPT=on&IMAGE_BZIMAGE=on&IMAGE_COMBOOT=on&AUTOBOOT_CMD=on&NVO_CMD=on&CONFIG_CMD=on&IFMGMT_CMD=on&IWMGMT_CMD=on&ROUTE_CMD=on&IMAGE_CMD=on&DHCP_CMD=on&SANBOOT_CMD=on&LOGIN_CMD=on&embedded_script=&A=Get+Image
